<h1>The Best Movies (according to Scott)</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>A Quiet Place</h3>

<p>It feels like every shot has been considered incredibly carefully as the film ticks like a clock on a bomb, perfectly balancing scares with scenes that set up the emotional stakes and the world of these characters. The film has a beautiful sense of geography, almost all of it taking place on a farm that Krasinski and his technical team lay out in a way that allows us to feel like we know it. This is not one of those films that mistakes shaky camerawork for horror storytelling. It’s got a refined visual language that plays beautifully with perspective and the terrifying nature of a world in which we can’t yell to warn/find people or, in the case of the deaf daughter, hear what’s coming.</p>

<h3>Elf the Movie</h3>

<p>This is one of those rare Christmas comedies that has a heart, a brain and a wicked sense of humor, and it charms the socks right off the mantelpiece. Even the unexpected casting is on the money. James Caan as the elf's biological father. Yes! Bob Newhart as his adoptive elf father. Yes! Mary Steenburgen as Caan's wife, who welcomes an adult son into her family. Yes! Zooey Deschanel as the girl who works in a department store and falls for his elfin charm. Yes! Faizon Love as Santa's elf manager -- does it get any better than this? Yes, it does. Peter Dinklage, who played the dwarf in "The Station Agent," has a brief but sublime scene in which he cuts right to the bottom line of elfhood.</p>

<h3>Shaun of the Dead</h3>

<p>On top of the extremely funny splatter moments, Shaun of the Dead works as a great mid-life crisis dramedy, thanks to Pegg's relatable performance as the titular character. Seamlessly blending humor with existential drama, Shaun of the Dead is an instantly memorable and hilarious comedy about coming-of-age in adulthood. The film has become a certified classic, with many considering it among the all-time best zombie movies. Shaun of the Dead is also closely related to Pegg's image, to the point it might be the first movie that comes to mind when thinking of the actor.</p>
